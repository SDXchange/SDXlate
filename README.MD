Exchanging System Dynamics Models
---------------------------------

SDXchange is about helping System Dynamics modelers exchange and otherwise manipulate simulation models outside of the tool in which the model was authored. Our initial focus is on creating, collecting, and refining translators and adapters that will translate models between XMILE and other model representations. 

The first tool is a DYNAMO to XMILE translator, accompanied by a small adapter that will reformat the XMILE into .stmx for Stella import. 

Technical details will be posted later.
