Exchanging System Dynamics Models
---------------------------------

SDXchange is about helping System Dynamics modelers exchange and other manipulate simulation models outside of the tool in which the model was authored. Our inital focus is on creating, collecting, and refining translators and adapters that will translate models between XMILE and other model representations. 

The first tool is a DYNAMO to XMILE translator. Technical details will be posted later.
