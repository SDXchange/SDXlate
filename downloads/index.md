# Translators

### Java-Based

These stand-alone java stand-alone applications (packaged as .jar files)  will translate from various modeling representations to XMILE and from XMILE to other modeling representations. 
Each translator link will take you to a separate page with download and installation instructions. 

Currently we offer these translations:

- [*Dynamo to Xmile.*](dyn2xmile.html)
- [*Xmile to Stella.*](xmile2stella.html)

### Python-Based

These translators are available as part of the PySD project. 

- [*Smile to python.*](pysd.html)
- [*Xmile to python.*](pysd.html)
- [*Vensim to python.*](pysd.html)
