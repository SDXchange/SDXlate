# XMILE Models, Translation, Transport, and Exchange

SDXchange is an open source project devoted to enabling exchange of XMILE-coded System Dynamics simulation models. To that end, we foster

* the creation and publication of open source, stand-alone translators, both from other formats to Xmile and from Xmile to other formats;

* the exchange of Xmile models, through an open catalog of models available from our own model archive and other model archives;

* the creation and publication of tools that directly manipulate Xmile (for example model refactoring tools); and

* the creation and publication of embeddable Xmile components that make it easier for developers and experimenters to use Xmile models in their own projects.

For developer-oriented documentation and support, please see our [wiki](wiki).
