<span style="font-size:140%">SD**_X_**change</span>
is an open source project devoted to enabling exchange of XMILE-coded System Dynamics simulation models. To that end, we foster the creation and publication of open source, stand-alone translators, both from other formats to Xmile and from Xmile to other formats;

* the exchange of Xmile models, through an open catalog of models available from our own model archive and other model archives;

* the creation and publication of tools that directly manipulate Xmile (for example model refactoring tools); and

* the creation and publication of embeddable Xmile components that make it easier for developers and experimenters to use Xmile models in their own projects.

The tabs at the left above will take you to pages that list downloadable Xmile models and translation tools respectively.
