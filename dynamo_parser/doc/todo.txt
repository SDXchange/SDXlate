CI Backlog
===================================================
Fix xmile generation so top-level table doesn't generate both nested and top level output. See Bug1.xmile
Build jar for Dyn2Xmile
Update build targets and scripts to conform to new project structure and ANTLR4 requirements.
Regenerate xmile marshallers (jaxb)
Regenerate dynamo parser lexer /dynamoParser.g4 dynamolexer.g4
Create Xmile to Xframe builder and package in jar
Package Frame to Xmile Builder (from dynamo project) as jar

regenerate xmile files (from dynamo and other sources) as part of build
copy all xmile files to end-user library page. 

Backlog Architectural/DevKit
=====================================================
Refactor to eliminate dynamo and other upward dependencies from devkit. 
Add Policy object to control spacing in generated displays.


Backlog Dynamo parser
=================================================

Map TABLE vs TABHL differences


Push new version
Grammar rule for array initializers (T ID[*] = x,x,x) They cause a problem because treating as table fails to find tInfo. 

Test "compact if/else" in insight maker. 
map plot  start and stop times
map axis ranges.

Automate evaluation of parser test results. 
Research/Test whether "use functions" or "use macros" changes insightmaker behavior
capture line comments and card comments (which conform to doc standard) in symbol table.  
Generalize Function replacement mechanism. 
Codify Build Targets
... parser and lexer generation
... test execution
... executable jar creation
... xmile marshaller generation
... Build should deploy an app for convenient manual testing
... graphical front end to app 

Convenient download of working tools from site. 
Create cross compile runner. 

Backlog Vensim parser
===============================================================
Extract intermediate form from Vensim (enough to mimic dynamo?)
load intermediate form into symbol table 
 

Backlog InsightMaker Output Adapters
================================================
Generate Display
Package as app with file input/output
Isolate Graph inputs
Package as jar file. 

Backlog Stella Output Adapter
===============================================
Retest, 
eliminate use of m4, (shouldn't be necessary with new Dyn2Xmile.) 
Add limitations to usage message. 
Perform xsl transform from Java
package as jar file. 

Backlog Stella to Xmile
===================================================
Test how much we can accomplish in a Java-based XSL transform 

 Completed
 ==========================================
 2015-07-16 Create Xmile to XFrame unmarshaller. 
 2015-07-12 Create g4 parser for conforming Xmile expressions. 
 Conformance: add version attribute to xmile tag
 Conformance: remove name from "root" model. 
 Conformance: Options .. uses_outputs --- has modelview
 Conformance: Product version
 Conformance: Stacked Container must have x,y,width,height, __uid__ 
 Conformance: implement "printable view" (see list of required attributes) (TABLE)
 Conformance: Flows must support equation and lookup (but maybe I don't have to use both when generating)
 Conformance: Aux must support both equation and lookup (but not mixed?) 
 Conformance: Plot element attributes index, title, entity (support for, but not required use)
	add title? 
 
 rename dynbare grammar
 Codify Build Targets
... parser and lexer generation
 Determine Current State of examples
 Preprocess to collapse continuation lines. Used rewriter instead. 
 Make dependency graph/view generation depend only on Symbol table if possible. 
 Restore Dynamo Samples to original form. 
 ... Dependency extraction for graph
... Nested function references
... Replacement with target macro/function
... Eliminate need for segment headers in Dynamo input
