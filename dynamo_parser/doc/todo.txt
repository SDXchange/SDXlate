Backlog Dynamo parser
=================================================

Conformance: remove name from "root" model. 
Conformance: add version attribute to xmile tag

Push new version
Grammar rule for array initializers (T ID[*] = x,x,x) They cause a problem because treating as table fails to find tInfo. 

Test "compact if/else" in insight maker. 
map plot  start and stop times
map axis ranges.

Automate evaluation of parser test results. 
Research/Test whether "use functions" or "use macros" changes insightmaker behavior
capture line comments and card comments (which conform to doc standard) in symbol table.  
Generalize Function replacement mechanism. 
Codify Build Targets
... parser and lexer generation
... test execution
... executable jar creation
... xmile marshaller generation
... Build should deploy an app for convenient manual testing
... graphical front end to app 

Convenient download of working tools from site. 
Create cross compile runner. 

Backlog Vensim parser
===============================================================
Extract intermediate form from Vensim (enough to mimic dynamo?)
load intermediate form into symbol table 
 

Backlog Output Adapters
================================================


 Completed
 ==========================================
 rename dynbare grammar
 Codify Build Targets
... parser and lexer generation
 Determine Current State of examples
 Preprocess to collapse continuation lines. Used rewriter instead. 
 Make dependency graph/view generation depend only on Symbol table if possible. 
 Restore Dynamo Samples to original form. 
 ... Dependency extraction for graph
... Nested function references
... Replacement with target macro/function
... Eliminate need for segment headers in Dynamo input
