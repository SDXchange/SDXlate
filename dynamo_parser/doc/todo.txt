Backlog Dynamo parser
=================================================
Determine Current State of examples
Automate evaluaton of parser test results. 
Preprocess to collapse continuation lines. 
Research/Test whether "use functions" or "use macros" changes insightmaker behavior
Make dependency graph/view generation depend only on Symbol table if possible. 
Treat each reference to a function as a separate variable instance in the symbol table.
capture line comments and card comments (which conform to doc standard) in symbol table.  
Restore Dynamo Samples to original form. 
Generalize Function replacement mechanism. 
... Dependency extraction for graph
... Nested function references
... Replacement with target macro/function
... Eliminate need for segment headers in Dynamo input
Codify Build Targets
... parser and lexer generation
... test execution
... executable jar creation
... xmile marshaller generation
... Build should deploy an app for convenient manual testing
... graphical front end to app 

Convenient download of working tools from site. 
Create cross compile runner. 

Backlog Vensim parser
===============================================================
Extract intermediate form from Vensim (enough to mimic dynamo?)
load intermediate form into symbol table 
 

Backlog Output Adapters
================================================


 Completed
 ==========================================
 rename dynbare grammar
 Codify Build Targets
... parser and lexer generation
