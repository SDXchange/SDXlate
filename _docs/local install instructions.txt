to create a local repository

mkdir a directory where you want the repository to reside. The name of this directory is not
significant. 

cd into the new directory and create an empty git repository with 
execute git init

clone the remote github pages branch into the new repository:
 git clone -b gh-pages http://github.com/SDXchange/SDXlate
 
 in addition to getting the desired code, this sets up the proper local/remote tracking relationship
 between the local and remote images. 
 
 The local image is complete. 
 
 To serve the image with the same relative paths as it will have when served from github,
 
 cd to the git directory(NOT the SDXlate directory), and use this command to start jekyll
jekyll serve --source ./SDXlate --baseurl '/SDXlate'

The single quotes are essential. For some reason, I found it easier to run this command from a dos command
line than from a unix shell. Probably because the forward slash keeps windows from 
expanding the arguments into full path references. 

Now all relative references in the markdown and html will be relative /SDXlate in 
both the remote sever and the local server.
