# MODELS

## Under Construction

The XMILE files on this page were translated from DYNAMO models used to test our Dyn2Xmile translator. Since DYNAMO is intrinsically dimensionless, these models are all dimensionless. 

The view portion of these models was "synthesized" by placing nodes at relatively arbitrary points on a grid. 

* **_Teacup._** A simple one-stock goal seeking model, conceptually of a cup of hot tea cooling to room temperature.  We have made no attempt to calibrate to real world behavior. [Download.](teacup.xmile)

* **_Probability Density Integrator._** A minimal one-stock accumulator with lookup table. The table is a rough approximation to a normal probability distribution. When integrated it approximates a probability density function. [Download.](pdf.xmile)

* **_Simple Epidemic Model._** This classic three stock model is translated from an example in _Introduction to System Dynamics Modeling with Dynamo_.<span style="font-style:super;">1</span>  [Download.](pugh_p96.xmile)

* **_Simple Project Model._** Also translated from an example in _Introduction to System Dynamics Modeling with Dynamo_. [Download.](pugh_p211.xmile)
